# Echoic Memory
Echoic memory is one of the sensory memory registers; a component of sensory memory (SM) that is specific to retaining auditory information.

And so, this is a Python app that connects to Spotify and Youtube APIs to seek the songs I want to hear, then saves them on the memory cortex (ElasticSearch) to give me clever suggestions of what to listen next.
